            <h2>Moses 6: 32-34</h2>
            <p>
                32 And the Lord said unto Enoch: Go forth and do as I have commanded thee, and no man shall pierce thee. Open thy mouth,
                and it shall be filled, and I will give thee utterance, for all flesh is in my hands, and I will do as seemeth me good.
                
                33 Say unto this people: Choose ye this day, to serve the Lord God who made you.
                
                34 Behold my Spirit is upon you, wherefore all thy words will I justify; and the mountains shall flee before you, and
                the rivers shall turn from their course; and thou shalt abide in me, and I in you; therefore walk with me.

            <h3> Helaman 10: 4 - 5</h3>
            <p>
                4 Blessed art thou, Nephi, for those things which thou hast done; for I have beheld how thou hast with unwearyingness
                declared the word, which I have given unto thee, unto this people. And thou hast not feared them, and hast not sought
                thine own life, but hast sought my will, and to keep my commandments.
                
                5 And now, because thou hast done this with such unwearyingness, behold, I will bless thee forever; and I will make thee
                mighty in word and in deed, in faith and in works; yea, even that all things shall be done unto thee according to thy
                word, for thou shalt not ask that which is contrary to my will.
